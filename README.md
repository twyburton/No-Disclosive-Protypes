# Non Disclosive Protypes

Prototype functions designed to address the problem of disclosive scatter plots.

Possible Solutions:

- Bubbble Plot - Similar to a heatmap but using size of point to represent density 
- Simulated Data - Overlays synthetic data over the real data so it is not possible to work out whether a point is real or synthetic. ( Possible weaknesses with Random Number Generation )
- Mean Plotting - This involves finding the nearest neigbours of each point and finding the mean. ( There are several possible approaches. This technique is limitted by the speed of calculation )
